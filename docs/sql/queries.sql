-- Meaningful SQL queries demonstrating JOIN, WHERE, GROUP BY, HAVING, ORDER BY,
-- aggregates, and subqueries. Adjust dates as needed for your demo.

-- 1) Trips with route, bus, driver names between dates (JOIN + WHERE + ORDER)
SELECT t.id AS trip_id,
       r.name AS route_name,
       t.departure_time, t.arrival_time,

-- 4) Top drivers by number of trips in a date range (GROUP + ORDER)
SELECT CONCAT(d.first_name,' ',d.last_name) AS driver,
       COUNT(*) AS trips_count

-- 5) Passengers with more than one booking (HAVING)
SELECT p.full_name, p.phone, COUNT(b.id) AS bookings
FROM passengers p
         JOIN bookings b ON b.passenger_id = p.id
GROUP BY p.id
HAVING COUNT(b.id) > 1
ORDER BY bookings DESC;

-- 6) Find overlapping assignments for the same driver (self-join + time overlap)
SELECT t1.id AS trip1, t2.id AS trip2, d.id AS driver_id,
       CONCAT(d.first_name,' ',d.last_name) AS driver_name
FROM trips t1
         JOIN trips t2 ON t2.id > t1.id

WHERE t1.status = 'SCHEDULED' AND t2.status = 'SCHEDULED'
  AND t1.departure_time < t2.arrival_time
  AND t2.departure_time < t1.arrival_time;

-- 7) Buses available at a given time window (NOT EXISTS with subqueries)
-- Example: check availability for 2025-10-06 09:00â€“10:00
SELECT b.id, b.plate_number
FROM buses b
WHERE b.status = 'ACTIVE'
  AND NOT EXISTS (
    SELECT 1 FROM trips t
    WHERE t.bus_id = b.id
      AND t.status = 'SCHEDULED'
      AND t.departure_time < '2025-10-06 10:00:00'
      AND t.arrival_time   > '2025-10-06 09:00:00'
)
  AND NOT EXISTS (

    WHERE m.bus_id = b.id
      AND m.status IN ('SCHEDULED','IN_PROGRESS')

);

-- 8) Refunds summary by status (GROUP + ORDER)
SELECT status, COUNT(*) AS cnt, SUM(amount) AS total_amount
FROM refunds
GROUP BY status
ORDER BY FIELD(status,'REQUESTED','APPROVED','PAID','DECLINED');

-- 9) Upcoming maintenance schedule per bus (ORDER)
SELECT b.plate_number, m.start_time, m.end_time, m.reason, m.status
FROM bus_maintenance m
         JOIN buses b ON b.id = m.bus_id
WHERE m.start_time >= CURRENT_DATE()
ORDER BY m.start_time;

-- 10) Ticket verifications per user/day (DATE + GROUP BY)
SELECT v.verified_by_user_id,
    DATE(v.verified_at) AS day,
    COUNT(*) AS verified_count
FROM ticket_verifications v
GROUP BY v.verified_by_user_id, DATE(v.verified_at)
